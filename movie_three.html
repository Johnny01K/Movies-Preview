        <p><b>REVIEW: </b>Watching The Matrix was an unforgettable experience. From the very first scene, I was hooked by the film’s atmosphere and unique vibe. It’s not just an action movie – it makes you think about reality in ways you wouldn’t expect. I found myself wondering: What if the world around us isn’t real? That kind of thought sticks with you long after the credits roll.</p>
